Hebb's notion of “mediating processes" in the form of "ringing neural
loops" is developed and particularized. The loops are token to be repre-
sentatives of motor acts, which octs they engoge when sufficiently activated.
The botic operation of the brain is that of establishing relative dominances
‘omong classes of competitive acts. Sensory factors function to correlate or
Interlink motor loops. Elementary conditioned reflexes ore regarded as inter
acting via their loop representatives in the brain without being emitted. The
properties of sets of interacting C's, and the conditions for the emergence
of self-facilitating cyclic patterns is the heart of this approach, It is shown
that this eyelic ringing condition is not merely characteristic of neural
ectivity but also powerfully shapes it.

Introduction

The following is a rapid outline survey of the central features of o functional
‘model of the operation of the nervous system, The first part will prosent the structure
of the bosic model. The second part will discuss a series of applications of the model
chosen to help illustrate basic principles.

We believe thot the people studying the operation of the brain by experimental
means have gone os far as is possible by the process of direct abstraction from facts.
The field is now ready for an over-all synthosis. Indeed most isolated parts of the
present model have been proposed and used by other people in some context. All that
‘we do is pull these isolated principles together, and show they ara all aspects of one
commen simple schomo or model, and that this model has a symbolic completeness, and
‘en adequacy to explain in causal terms the over-all aspects of brain operation, thot
could hardly be suspected when It was viewed piecomeal.

Being outsiders to the fields we are attempting to synthesize we are sure to meke
« great many errors that experts in the fiold will be easily able to spot and correct.

But we believe thet such errors will readily suggest their own corrections in the light
of the basic model we are presenting. If we clarify this model sufficicntly so that the
professionals in the fiold can take hold of it, and push it on to @ more adequate working
form, we will have accomplished our atm,

We will now discuss the model in a series of stages, each one progressively more
conerete than the proceeding one. As the model represents a radical new type of symbolic.
structure, we will bogin by discussing its general logical status, and in what sense It will
explain observed facts ot all. For this purpose we will use the logical status of physics
Wi
to bring out points of similarity and controst.

Then we will present cn obstract functional model, exposing the difference
between what we will call the perallel or brain calculator, ond the series or con=
ventional (IBM) calculators humons use.

This functional model will then be made more concrete in terms of o generalized
conditioned reflex principle (CRF), notions of random search (RS), and steady stote (SS)
‘etc., to be defined and explained.

Then we will discuss the problems of transloting this abstract model into underlying
Wiring diagrams and give « few basic opplicotions. And finally we will develop on over-
all flow diogram of the logical processing of correlations by the model which constitutes
the learning procest.

Even ot this level the model will remain highly abstract. None of the detailed
functions of the various centers, or the vorious ceil types will have been identified or
discussed, However, even ot this relatively superficial and cbstract level of presentation
© wide variety of specific experimental facts can be interpreted or predicted - « sampling
of which will take up the second port of the poper.

This framework is one into which the detailed facts on the functional roles of the
<ifferent centers and cell types can, we believe, be integrated. In so doing o vast arroy
of special effects can be interpreted under common principles, os we hope to show in later
popers. None of this more detailed level of interpretation, where the role of the centers
‘ond cell types is onolyzed, will be attempted here.

At its best all we are presenting Is a fromework to be filled in, a framework for
introducing a wide clots of new structures, and defining many new experiments, It iso
itt
long road between early abstract quantom formulations, and the synthesis of all known
facts of chemistry. We are only at o Bohr Atom stage of the operation of the nervous
system. But wo ore ct that stage. An over-all causol model can be presented, or so we
hope to make plausible, if not yet convincing in this poper.
1. THE BASIC MODEL 1
1, The Logical Stotus of the Model
«@) Comparison With Physics Models

The logical structure of the functional model of the nervous system to be outlined
in this paper differs morkedly from that of most existing models, os surveyed, for exomple,
by George (1962, Chopter IX). Therefore we will begin by discussing its general logical
status, and in what sense it will explain observed facts at all. For this purpose we will
Use the logical stotus of physics models tobring out points of similarity and contrast.

How does a physicist build his theoretical models? The textbooks often say some
thing to the effect that he makes o lot of observations and then abstracts directly from
the facts to get « theory. In this way Kepler found the principle "plonets hove elliptical
orbits", early biologists stated the general law “all dogs have tails", ond more recently
psychologists have noted correlations like those between breakdown patterns in adult
life and ospects of childhood behavior. A group of such cbstracted principles does not,
however, form a theory. The theory of classical mechanics, as embodied in Newton's
lows, is 0 model of a completely different type ond structure than Kepler's laws. Kepler's
lows ore directly abstracted from the observations.

Paychology has reached this Kepler stage. We believe that it is now ripe for an
over-all synthesis. We toke oll our facts and most of the isolated principles from others
tnd try to show that they con all be viewed within the framework of one common scheme,
‘or model, and that this model has o symbolic completeness much os physics models hove,
{t must be rememberod that physics models do not actually predict the details of real life
sitvotions. Rather they ore verified in a few highly specialized situations. Agreement
in such ortificiol, specialized situations is token essentially as proof thot the theory is
2
correct in principle. However, for almest all epplications to real life we use not the
mathematical theory, but nature, as our calculator - I.ey we do experiments - we
measure such things os coefficients of friction, reaction rates, etc. - and we interpret
these results os noture-caleulator operations, carried out in accordance with the principles
of the theory. The theory Is accepted if these experimental results do not lead to contra-
dictions when they are fed back into the theory and used to drow further consequences.
For example, they must not contradict the theory's loose quelitetive predictions. Their
‘over-all pattern must be that predicted by the theory, but it is not required thot the theory
«5 applied in practice be capable of predicting the detoils of real life situations quanti-
totively.

‘A model of the nervous system clearly can do ng better. Physics does not predict
chemistry although we take it os subsuming chemistry in principle. The workings of the
nervous systom ore ultimately biochemical in nature and if physies cannot predict the
simplest chemistry it certainly cannot predict the biochemistry of nervous processes. The
many quantitative effects that depend on the volues of continuous parameters will be
loft to nature as the calculator as in physics and chemistry. Though physics can never
predict the details of the waves of the sca, it can predict their existence, their amplitude
cond wave length and general dynamics. In short, their pattern can be predicted. Further
more, the specificity thot is left Is regarded as irrelevant. When we realize thot itis the
pattern of behavior, not the quantitative details, thot motters subjectively, this focus on
pattern does not appear as such a significant restriction. If conflicts in the determination
of over-all pattern con be resolved, this is enough - it is all we need or wont in practice.

Al tho theories of physics stort with an abstract sot of assumptions and proceed by
@ long process of construction to the prediction of certain observed regularities. In this
3
way © great variety of consequences can follow from a few basic laws. Where do the
theories of physics come from if not from direct abstraction from experimental facts?
Roughly, they come from the mutual reconciliation of the principles that were abstracted
from the experimental facts. More specifically, the principles when compared with one
cenother, when their consequences are elaborated, lead to contradictions among one
cenother. The removal of these contradictions gradually forces up @ now type of model
whose function it is to synthesize or resolve contradictions among the principles directly
abstracted from the experimental facts. Physics provides an adequate framowork to
resolve inconsistencies in the principles of chemistry and to guide rescarch. In chemistry,
If the nature-caleulator step cannot be shown to be inconsistent with the laws of physics
it is essumed to be @ compounding of them.

Many people expect that all the principles should be deducible from the synthesizing
model. Sometimes this is true: Kepler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. But
more often it is not true: quantum mechanics cannot be shown to imply many of the
principles of biochemistry. Only recently were any of the principles of superconductivity
shown to follow from quantum mechanics.

It is enough if the synthesizing model can resolve inconsistencies in the princlples
isewy define more precisely the domain of validity of the principles thot are contradictory.

There is a widespread subconscious demand of "predictability" in many minds which
con paralyze, In effect it restricts models to simple abstractions from observed facts.

The whole concept of "prodictobility must be differentiated. In classical physics
we often can predict the principles from the over-all model. In quantum theory we can
predict only certain of the principles - most of chemistry cannot bo deduced from
quantum theory. As opplied fo the nervous system we must further rclax, or generalize,
4
-- the notion of predictability. If we con resolve inconsistencies among principles used
to detormine or predict our own behavior this pushes as for into the quantitative detoils
of this behavior os we have either need or desire to go in predictive terms, Wo shall
cttempt to present a scheme which does this. The principles of psychology ore ripe for
this synthesis, boing stuffed with the latent syntactic contradictions needed to guide the
building of more complex synthesizing models.

We will not present a model of the nervous system any more than physics presonts @
model of the world. Such a model, even in s0 for os possible, is lorgely confusing ond
irrelevant. A model of the solar system moy hide implicit in it Newton's laws, but it is
‘ot the some as Newton's laws. Similarly, models illustrating the functional inter-
dependence of the brain centers ore useful when presented os illustrative manifestations

we ‘of the underlying laws of brain operation, but such models do not constitute the laws.
Whot physics does is provide o set of general procedures by which specific regularities
In noture can be compounded of the fundamental laws. And these procedures ore far
from reduced to an algorithm. Great ingenuity wos required to show that quantum theary
prodicted the existence of the exchango force so central to chemistry.

Another moral thot con be drawn from a study of physics models is that there need be
10 direct, obvious relationship between the basic postulates of a model ond the principles
oF facts that it will be used fo synthesize ond predicts For examplo, in quantum theory
the wave function is itself not observable, but from it one can, by @ long process of con
struction derive predictions of the properties of directly measurable quantitios..

{In addition, ono sees in physics how relatively few basic laws can be compounded to

ee yield explanations of a wide variety of phenomena, Despite the great multiplicity of
observed effects the logical depth is relatively thin.
5

The problem of building models of relevance for explaining the over-all pottern of
the outputs of the nervous system is less awesome if the notion of predictability is relaxed
5 discussed above, It is also essential to recognize the power of a few basic laws which
bear no obvious relationship to the multitudinous underlying facts to provide, in combination, and properly elaborated, o predictive synthesis of them.

b. Nature of the Principles of Brain Function

The principles of brain operation will consist of a set of procedures for translating
specific steps in learning into underlying wiring diagrams. In this approach, implications
for structure are drawn from a functional model. This approach may be contrasted with
that of Rosenblatt (1958, 1962) and Block (1962) in which the emphasis is on the con
struction of certain electronic structures that function in certain respects like the nervous

: system.

We view learning negatively: as reduction in the randomness of sequences of
behavioral elements, rather than as the incorporation of order in a blank photographic
plate. The totality of these translations of specific steps in the reduction of the randomnes:
of behavioral sequences into wiring diagrams constitutes the present model. The model of
the brain, like physics models of the world, will only be implicit in the structure of the
translation procedures.

Now in physics the key-orienting concept for systematizing the patterns of inanimate
nature hs turned out fo be measurement of time and position. It was measurement of
these quontities (not color, ownership, or location of experiment, etc.) that led to success
ful theories in physics. To people belicving in magic and spirits this orientation can seem
‘

completely unmotivated and revolutionary. Now we take it so much for granted that it
Is hard fo conceive of alternatives.

What corresponding special orientation will arise in systematizing brain function?
‘As is suggested above in the "negative" definition of learning (the rock contains the
stotue, the sot of letters contains all novels ever to be written), the key orientation to
building « model of the nervous system is found in a concentration on changes in the
order of emission of mutually exclusive behavioral elements, More specifically, we will
concentrate on changes which reduce, narrow, or restrict the range of possible random
‘emitted sequences of mutually exclusive behovioral factors. That is, we focus on changes
in the order of emission of a sot of given mutually exclusive acts that result in the emer
‘gence, or make possible the appearance, of pattern in the outputs; changes that reduce
the random character of the outputs; or, in short, those changes that bring order out of chaos.

The great variety of behavioral outputs is viewed much os « linguist views a “Rosetta
‘Stone" of unfamiliar characters which he is trying to decode. Presented with sequences
cof mutually exclusive choracters he focusses on regularities in the order of the choracters
that result in a narrowing of the range of possible orderings, for it is here that the meaning
lies.

To summarize, the principles of brain operation which will be presented can be viewed
28 a systematic method of translation of specific changes or norrowings in the range of orders
of emitted behaviors into closses of underlying wiring diagrams of nerve connections that.
could effect such changes.

Now the actual translation into underlying wiring diagrams will, for the most port,
moke use of nature os a calculator - ises, anatomical and neurophysiological data,
For the most part the model only indicates classes of posstats wiring changes that might
contribute to the observed narrowing of rondoness, i.e, to the learning in question.
Nevertheless, such results ore of greot significance and can radically reorient research,
‘Thus physics suggests the existence of electromognetic waves, but aside from the simplest
idealizations we must uso nature ({.e. experiments) to calculate how to design real
‘ontennos, etc.
2. The Conditioned Reflex Principle os the Besic Building Block

IF the phrase “conditioned response" (CR) is used to refer to the whole input-output,
stimulus-response sequence then os many authors have pointed out (e.g. Simpson, 1957),
it is clearly impossible to explain behavior in terms of CR's. However, at the core of the
CR concept there is @ functional principle which does form an adequate besic building
block. The conditioned reflex principle (CRP) may be sioted: “If the firing of en exon
‘ending Is correlated with local excitation in the area of thet ending ot the time of firing,
some change occurs (whose exact nature is not yet fully understood - perhops growth, or
chemical change, ete.) which serves to facilitete firing in that oreo in future when thot
‘oxon is fired". The CRP is just on olternative statement of Hebb's (1949, p.62) neuro
physiological postulate.

If monosynaptic inhibition exists, es described by Wilson and Lloyd (1956), then a
reverse statement holds, namely, "if the orea into which the axon fires is inhibited ot
the time of firing, then Its future firing produces a local inhibition there". If mono
synoptic inhibition does not exist, os described by Eecles, Fatt, and Landgren (1959), ther
the picture is complicated slightly by the presence of on inhibitory interneuron. The
present functional model is independent of the outcome of this controversy.

Ina sonte, the brains of advanced animals are a simplification, genetically, over
the brains of lower animals, in lower animals the CR is more nearly an adequate boss
of all behavior: sensory stimuli elicit necessary, stereotyped responses. Higher animals
core to larger and larger degrees released from the goneticaily defined dominance of these
fixed responses - learning becomes more possible becouse of the replacement of a
rigidly “wired-vp" norvous system by 0 loosely wired-up network of diffuse random inter
connections which interconnections can be, in effect, altered by the CRP. A general
mode of operation replaces « uniquely wired-up gadget, moking possible greater
edoptability.

The effect of the CRPis to push things to extremes. If B follows A then the effect of
the CRP is to moke 8 follow A sooner, ond more often, ond with more violence (i.e. 6
greater number of nerve fibers firing simultaniously). There is no internal regulation to
the CRP - its whole implication is to throw everything out of kilter. The only thing
thot stops the strengthening of a CR is thot it itself excites antagonistic effects.

‘The CRP links the exterior continuous, analog world of physics, oriented by meosure-
iments of lengths and times, to the interior discrote, digital world of brain operation
oriented by concepts of order among mutually exclusive acts. Via the CRP external
correlations (released objects fall towords earth) become internal ones as well. Thus the
CRP links the two worlds. Via the CRP. ropresentation of the external world is gradually
incorporeted into the brain. Furthermore, the CR itself portokes of both analog and digital
cospects, The frequency of firing, the speed of nervous impulses, the degree of excitation
needed to trigger © cell are all continvously-varioble, or enalog, parameters. The discrete,
digital aspect of C's Is manifested in the lt-or-nothing character of the nervous impulses,
°

in the fact thot the amplitudes of impulses do not carry information. Information is
corried In large port by the excitation of distinct paths or patterns of paths, a digital
characteristics

A central contention of this model is that the aspect of human behavior called
“meaningful is almost entirely on tho digital side. Continuous variation in the pottern
(cs of « letter) is not regarded as meaningful until the pattern changes altogether. This,
Cf course, accounts for the concentration discussed earlier on order chonges in sets of
‘emitted acts: order changes affect the over-all pattern; continuous variations in quality
‘ore mecningful to us only in so far os they lead to such order changes. The failure to
separote out the pure pattern or order aspects of brain operation from the onalog effects
(thresholds, time of response, etc.) has been a great block to building brain models,
The cybernetic approach has been key in emphasizing this, Until we focus on pottern
wwe see only a choos of interdependencies.

3 Series ond Porallel Computers

Some comparison of the brain calculator, with the better understood digital calcula
ting machines may help orient its over-all functional character. The distinction between
series computers (prototype: IBM) and parallel computers (piototype: brain) is based on
some remarks of von Neumann (1958, ps 51). A conventional digital calculator is @
programmed adding machine, in which millions of operations may toke place, one after
the other, in series, ot high speed, Any error in any one of these millions of series steps
usually mokes the final answer altogether absurd. Not only is the information processed
sequentially but it is taken into the machine one piece ot a times
10

In contrast fo this conventional series calculator, the brain may be viewed as @
parallel calculator in which not one, but thousands of processes go on side by side
influencing one another. Actual calculations in such o parallel calculator involve only
@ relatively small number of series stops, but many independent parallel factors contribute
to the soloction of each step. In o parallel calculator there is room for errors in the
vorious parallel branches without effecting the final result, since redundoncy can be
used via effects of cumulation to distinguish the "true" answer ino wide variety of wayse
A parallel computer not only processes information in parallel, it olso takes in lots of
information simultaneously.

A parallel calculator contains @ wide rango of random connections adapted fo picking
vp correlations, Indeed this forms what might be viewed as its basic functional distinction
from a series calculator. The parallel calculator is designed to pick up correlations, to
sift for and isolate new significant correlations. The series calculator is designed to
help establish the consequences of correlations alroady well defined. OF course these
distinctions are not absolute. But they do represent dominant aspects of the functional
specialization of each type of machine.

Because of the parallel operation, and the use of redundancy and cumulation to
distinguish, o porallel calculator can operate way beneath the “noise level". Only @
small fraction of existing nervous activity Is ever relevant to the present conscious state,
‘Asin an FM radio set, s0 in the brain, redundancy is used to ollow a wide range of inter-
ction, and still pull out the dominant, The recognition of this greatly simplifies end
extends possibilities of brain design in ways that ot first glance would seom to represent
too great o mutual interference of paths for consistent reliable operation.
u
4, The Chain Medel

We have now to examine this parallel function in somewhat more detail, We will
stort with a loose abstract functional formulation, which we will gradually moke more
concrete. In Section 11 we will discuss how fo translate these functional schemes into
wiring diagrams. We will first position the wires in an indirect functional way, rather
thon in spatial terms, and only later discuss the problem of spatial positioning.

The nervous system functions via the CRP to link together the past historical sequenco
of acts, Thus, if act B followed act A in the post, then the facitiation of act A will tend
to facilitate act 8, increasing its probability of occurence,

Life can be crudely viewed as 0 long chain of acts, the CRP providing the linkege
between the individvel acts or links. Consider the sequence of acts

ABCADPCAQD PQCACPAK Queer
‘Act A hos been followed in the (essentially random) sequence by acts B, D, Q, C, and
K. Hence by the CRP all these five acts will be facilitated ot once when act A next
occurs or is noxt facilitated.

From on over-all point of view the life chain, a sequence of acts, hes been broken
vp into pieces and these pieces (Individual acts) have been brought into parallel. Acts
‘re brought into parallel if and only if they are competitive or equivalent - i.e.
capable of following a given act (A).

Now the basic operation of the brain as a parallel calculator is that of establishing
«@ relative dominance (RD) as among these competitive or equivalent acts thus brought
into parallel. The concept of the parallel computer is thus made more concrete by
recognizing thet that which is brought into parallel ore the motor-defined sequences
12
themselves. Suppose C is the dominant act - ies, C is the act of the set of five
(8D QC K) which comes to regulorly follow A, How does this come about? Whot
does this mean? This would mean that the facilitation of any of tho possible acts
BD Q K (or nerve branches which represent these acts) would lead to the facilitation
of C, but that the facilitation of C would lead to the inhibition of BO QK. The
recessive, or rejected bronches, 8 D @ K, are used os an essential part of the mechanism
for conditioning the dominant branch C.

5 Dd
ae
a Looe
Sk

C is the dominant oct, or RD, but the phrase RD is also used to refer to the relationship
that exists omong the whole set of competitive acts (BD QC K) - namely the particular
relationship in which B D Q K facilitate C and C inhibits 8 D Q K. Thus the dominant
act is not defined directly, but only indirectly relative to the rejected possibilities. Again
notice that learning is a weeding process. Because of this it is much easier to condition
‘a given response - one has not merely the proceeding act, but also the whole class of
acts which have previously followed that act, to use in defining and, subsequently, in
reselecting the dominant.

We will now examine this basic operation of the nervous system (establishing o RD.
‘among a set of competitive factors) in more detail to see: (1) what factors define as
equivalent class of competitive acts, and (2) what criteria operate fo sclect over that
class and so define an RD.
13
5. Random Search
So fr we have thought of an equivalence class of competitive acts as a set of motor
‘outputs all copoble of following © given act A - they lie passively in parallel ofter A.
The elements of this class are mutually exclusive via reciprocal enervation (RE We ore
here using RE in o generalized symbolic form as the nervous basis of the separation of
mutvolly exclusive acts. Now a particular equivalence class also hos an active ospect
It can be viewed as @ random search (RS). A given state of excitation in the brain (what
psychologists call a given "drive" or “drive factor") hos associated with it on equivalence
loss of emittable acts which possibly upon emission drain off or lesson this excitation.
This equivalence class of acts hos many competitive members. They ore all facilitated
by the drive factor in question and are scorched over randomly. We can emphasize this
i ‘active aspect of the equivalence class of acts (which lie possively in parallel) by referring
to the class of acts as the associated RS of the given state of excitation or drive factor.
‘The basic correlations of the nervous system are defined only relative to an active probing;
they ere not conditioned as passive responsoss
Typical “drive factors" are hunger and discomfort. Different drive factors excite
different RS's: 0 poin in the toe excites 0 different class of “thrashes" in an infant than
hunger or cold, We begin our analysis with many RS's, excited or selected, by various
drive factors Then we concentrate on changes in the order of emission of these mutually
exclusive behavioral elements - changes that reduce, narrow, or restrict the range of
possible random emitted sequences of members of the equivalence class of acts.
How does this come about? Assume that a certain sequence of acts is hit upon by
‘accident which stops the RS, ists which quiets or satisfies the ossociated drive factor.
4

This combination of acts follows others and others do not follow it, This fact alone gives
this combination or this sequence a preference. Any other sequence of acts which does
not stop the RS is followed by other sequences which, via the CRP, {means o further
shifting of the interconnections among the elements of the searched over equivalence
class, Only a combination that stops the RS stops the shifting of the interconnections. The
lost set of interconnections Is not altered ond its continued ringing builds It into « dominant
sequence, the RD for the equivalence class. What stops a RS is reinforced again and
‘again = every time the associated drive factor is excited - because what satisfies o
drive factor once will do s0 again. Such correlations are invariants The correlation of
searchod-over factors, ise, the relationship among the acts in the equivalence class which
stops the RS is the RD or the invariant correlations

A child's learning consists of the discovery of more and more RD through interacting
with its environment. The establishment of RD's introduces elements of order into the sets
of mutually exclusive behavioral elements with which the animal starts - its uncorrelated
repertoire. Now with the solving out of a particular RS via the isolation of an RO, another
RS takes possession of the organism. The historical sequence of RS's bocomes linked
together into @ chain via the CRP much as, at a lower level, the more elementary motor
‘acts ("twitches") which formed a sequence historically were linked together via the CRP.
The links of this new chain ore equivalence classes of parallel acts excited simultaneously
which were originally randomly searched over, but are now spanned by an 2D. The RD's
thus become tied together in a chain and are themselves brought into parallel by the CRP
tend searched over randomly. A dominant RD may emerge from this set as that RD which
stops the RS over the set of RD's, Logically the functional structuro is identical to that
of the previous analysis, The only difference is that here the elements of the equivalence
Ss
closs which is searched over are more highly individuoted, being RD's, ise. being the
results of previous RS's.

‘Thus far wo have considered only chains whose links ore acts which are actually
enacted. We have not yet introduced the functional counterport of thought, an internal
process, not necessitating external action and in fact incompatible with it. All chains
discussed s0 for are enacted link by link.

6. Internalization of Random Search and Series Elaboration

We shall examine the translation from the present over-all functional picture to wiring
diagrams in more detoil later, However, in order to discuss internal thought processes we
rust anticipate slightly. For this purpose it will for the time being suffice to think of acts,

F ‘05 hoving higher internal representatives which in fact determine the emission or non=
‘omission of the associated act. These representatives are, roughly, loops. The coming into
‘existence ond the stability of loops will be derived from the CRP in Section 11. If nervous
stimulation flows around o loop and this ropeats, then recruitment occurs (via CRP) and the
‘sociated act is emitted while alternatives are inhibited (via the generalized principle
of RE).

In connecting together post historical sequences, the nervous system elevates the past
event into a habit, moking it "predictive" of the future. Thought can be followed as the
gradual differentiation of these "predictive" conditioned reflex patterns, patterns "predictive"
of one's own behaviors

It may happen that the links in the chon of RD's become sufficiently well correlated
that chain links are excited several stages chead of act A prior to enactment of A. This
6
internal “predicting chead'", or facilitation of successive motor loops, is apt to affect
the emission of the RD (A) which is potentially about to be enacted, because the loop
representation of the series of acts 8, C, etc. thot follow A may have recurrent collaterals
back to loop A which inhibit it. Unless loop A repeats ond recruits before successive
motor loops re excited that inhibit it, A will not be emitted. Instead @ new loop representative corresponding to another potential next act (K) Is selected. If before K can be
emitted a series of loops has been excited that inhibits K, then K also may not be emitted
cond still another possible "next act be selected. We call the series of acts (8, C, D) that
follow a candidate for emission (A) before emission of A, the series oloboration (SE) of act
‘As The SE of A has a logical structure in the sense that the correlations, 8 - C,C -D,
reflect some external structure of the environment and pas! interaction with it, not merely
the biochemistry of the moment.

If @ loop representative of a RD has the property thot those loop representatives thot
follow it in the chain (its SE) do not function to inhibit it, then this loop repeats, recruits,
‘ond leads to the associated external act.

Now when the SE of an act undercuts it, preventing its emission, another candidate is
tried, If its SE prevonts its emission and this process continues we have in offect on internal
search over a set of potential acts (or their loop representatives). Thus on internal search
process whose structure closely parallels the external search process is set up. The internal
RS over a closs of RD's is concerned with latent inconsistencies in tho RD's estoblished by

: the external search. The internal search is generated by the over-generalized character of
these RO as first internalized.

The key distinction, however, between internal and external RS is that in external RS
we actually emit the acts whereas in internol RS it is just the loop represantatives of possible
7
‘cts in states of excitation short of emission that are searched over. Thought is viewed as
internal RS.

The basic operation of the brain as a parallel calculator may be regarded as one of
establishing o relative dominance as among @ set of parallel possibilities, each represented
by a loop, The rejected possibilities, which ore not emitted, nevertheless hove their os
sociated loop representatives excited, and these ore used to help condition or define the
dominant branch. The dominant is thus presented as conditioned in stoges by the successive
rejection of mombers of a field of possibles, This indirect stoge-by-stoge conditioning of
the dominant relative to « field of possibles makes feasible the use of simple elementary
conditioned reflexes in defining complex acts, The rejected, or mistoke-colored responses
become, despite their non-emission, the key to understanding the method of conditioning
of the complex dominant responses in simple step-by-step wayse

7. The Steady State Condition

The internal search continues until tho SE of @ given act is not such as to undercut this
‘act. When this occurs 0 repeating or steady state (SS) is achieved that leads to recruitment
and enactment of the act represented by the ringing loops and that particular internal RS
stops. The botic characteristic of the steady state, its leading to recruitment, or rapidly
increasing nervous activity and enactment, is; while implicit in the CRP, more directly
confirmed in o variety of experiments which show that o repeated stimulus opplied to the
brain leads to on augmenting and spreading response.

‘Thought can be viewed as a search for steady cycles. It is @ search for RD that stop
fon internal RS; isew it is @ search for RD's whose SE's are not such as to undercut them
18
‘and thus allow their enactment, We might soy thought is @ search for something we can
think of doing and still want to do.

‘The view of thought as a random search for steady eycles receives experimental
support in EEG studies. Steadiness implies synchronization of the subfactors, whereas the
search stoge implies de-synchronization. If the mode of operation of the nervous system
Is 05 simple ot its core os is Implied by the present model, one might expect thot this
difference would be directly manifest in the charactertstic electrical activity of the
brain. It is found experimentally that when in on “alert state, ready for ony possibility,
‘05 when trying to interpret sights or sounds, the widest range of random searches comes into
ploy, and the surface activity of the cortex as manifest in the EEG is desynchronized,
When working a mathematical problem, the range of motor possibilities is reduced prodve-
ing © relatively more synchronized cortical pattern.

Just 05 the term RO is used both to denote the dominant act among a closs of com
petitive alternatives ond the relationship that must exist between the dominant ect and
the equivalence class of which it is @ member, so the term SS is used both to denate the
condition of ringing of o given loop and the relationship that must exist between a ringing
loop and its SE in order that such ringing occur.

8, Relation of Sensory Inputs to Motor Outputs

Up to this point no mention has been made of the role played by sensory stimuli in
the theory. We have spoken of sets of competitive octs, the loop representations of motor
‘cts in the brain, the formation of RD's by external RS over sets of equivolent acts, the
selection of an act for enactment from the set of internally searched over (loop)
w
representatives of acts; the requirement for enactment that the SE of on oct not undercut
it and s0 permit the formation of a SS.

The role of the sensory factors has not been mentioned up to this point because we
toke the view that the motor correlations, the sequences of motor acts, provide the orienting
core for representing both the details and over-all character of brain function. The sensory
factors are most easily treated vio their effects on these bosic motor elements.

A-key experimental result suggesting this outlook Is represented by the well-known
fact that 0 dog conditioned to salivate to a bell will do so only if hungry. The sensory
stimulus can therefore not be said to cause the motor output, but only, sometimes, to elicit
It. A fundamental principle of this model is that sensory inputs only function to help inter-
link motor outputs. Sensory inputs only function to help correlate or interfacilitate motor
‘acts - they do not initiate the acts directly. Here the term "motor" is being used ina
generalized sense which includes salivation and other vegetative responses. Thus the
ringing of @ bell, followed by feeding, con condition a bell-dependent salivation response,
but this response will be elicited in a subsequent trial only if the dog is hungry. The sound
of the bell functions to interlink a RS initiated by @ drive foctor (in this case hunger) with
‘an act (in this case salivation). It does not of itself couse solivation,

‘The most obvious sensory inputs are those associated with sight, heoring, touch, taste
cond smell, There are also sensory devices (proprioceptors) within the muscles thot detect
cand measure the degree of contraction or extension of the muscle. Those internol sensory
Inputs make coordination possible. The brain also hos cells that respond when local
activity in different parts of the brain storts or stops - these internal sensory inputs ore
{5 important to the coordination of thought as the proprioceptors are to the coordination
of the musculature. All those sensory inputs serve only to make the possoge of nervous
stimulation from one motor link to another easier.
2»

We have said previously that our focus would be on changes in the order of erssion
of mutually exclusive behavioral elements, changes that norrow the range of possible
random emitted sequences of these (mutually exclusive) behavioral factors - changes
that bring order out of chaos. It is @ central contention of this model that only such
pattern changes are of subjective significance. Continuous variations in pattern are not
regarded os mesningful until they change the pattern altogether.

Since it is the order of emission that counts, @ sensory difference will not be dis
tinguished subjectively unless it leads to distinct orders of excitation at same point in
the SE of the motor steps It facilitates, Sensory inputs are only distinguished via the
distinctness of the motor loops they engage. Thus sensations have o subjective character
cnly in the process of engaging and to the extent that they engage or link motor sequences.
A particular room or smell or color engages the class of motor sequences which occurred

‘ in conjunction with it. As we change environment, the internel wiring remains the some,
but the class of CR's engaged or facilitated, over which an internal RS for an SS is conducted, changes - hence the emitted acts also change.

It is order of emission thot counts. Unless o sensory difference leads to distinct orders
of emission at some point in the series elaboration of the steps it influences, it cannot be
distinguished subjectively. It requires a distinct motor sequence, soparated off by reciprocal
‘enervation, to form a basis for conditioning at all. Sensory inputs can only be distinguished
via the distinctness of the motor loops thet they engage. As it takes some minutes of
ringing to establish on internal conditioning, it is only loops, which ore well distinguished
by the order of emissions into which they enter, that can be used for the estoblishment of
«© conditioned response.

9. Adequacy of the CR as the Bosic Building Block
Many people have felt the Pavlovian CR approach was inadequate to account for
the wide variety and adaptability of observed human behavior, This would certainly be
the cose if the emitted behavior were the expression of one CR, To adapt the CR concept
to the broad task of explaining complex human behavior the properties of sets of inter-
‘cting CR's must be considered. Via the intemal RS and the requirement that for emission
con act must satisfy the SS condition we compound a wide class of Cis in the determining
‘of a single act. That is, for emission an act must satisfy a whole set of conditions which
we refer to collectively as the SS condition. it must be such that tho SE of its internal
loop representative does not undercut it (ixes inhibit it, via recurrent collaterals, before
it can repeat, recruit, and lead to the emission of the act it represents). It is because we
; think chead (because we series elaborate) that these other factors (CR's) con shape the
resent act - shope it by rejecting it and forcing another, perhaps - but this is @ most
powerful shaping of behavior from an external point of views (In fact, it is @ central
contention of this model that the internal RS for SS is the basic shaper of behavior, not
the external conditions of reinforcement. This point is developed in the next section.)
We have seen how sensory stimuli from the environment engage different classes of
motor acts. That is, the sensory stimuli facilitate, or bring to the fore, different classes
‘of behavioral elements over which RS's occur. The environment selects the class of CR's
fo be compounded - i.e. to be combined end selected among for emission, As we change
environments the class of CR's engaged to form the SS changes - hence the emitted acts
also change. It is easy to see how a relatively few basic behavioral elements could give
rise, vio SS compounding, to an almost limitless variety of behaviors. The SS condition
for emission acts by selection from, not change of, the bosic CR building blocks.

Similarly, from the 26 letters of the alphabet we con compound an endless number of
different sequences, a small subset of which is mankind's entire literary output. If the
letter sequences are to be meaningful, they must satisfy conditions governing the compounding of the letters. Similarly there are conditions that the compounded C's must fulfill in
order to be emitted,

10, The Steady State Condition os the Controller of.
Reinforcement

We have seen how the SE of an act A effects the emission of A, Thus, if the SE does
not undercut A, A will be emitted. Alternatively, the SE may not lead to emission of A
but may quiet the drive factor which is generating the internal RS over the loops A, By
C, +++, one of which is A. For example, the internal RS moy be over a class of methods
for solving © mathematics problem. Method A Is tried - its SE (AFSC) tells us thot indeed
method A will prove successful if we first put the problem in a certain form which mokes
method A useable. Thus the SE does not result in permitting the immediate enactment of
‘A, but rather is s0 wired 0s to "set" A for emission once another sequence of preparing
‘cts has been carried out. It is easy to construct possible wiring diagrams that would oc
complish this. The loop representative of A could perhops be kept ringing ot a level just
short of emission (gain = 0.99) while the sequence of preparing acts wos carried out, the
final member of which could provide the additional facilitation to boost the gain of loop
A above 1.0, and thus lead to enactment. Loop A has then the character of a flywheel
waiting only to be engoged, Alternatively, the wiring might be such that the A necessarily
follows the next occurence of a given act or act sequence, In this case the linkage
between the act sequence and loop A is of the nature of « spigot or valve that shunts
nervous stimulation onto loop As
2

The internal RS is ended by A's SE (FS@) which possibly sends inhibitory wires back
(rectly or indirectly) fo the area in which the internal RS is occurring. If the RS was
for food and a guarentee of its availability one hour hence is discovered, then the SE will
function to quiet the drive factor which initiated the RS for food, perhaps by connections
via the hypothalamus which then inhibits the RS which Tt had previously initiated. Thus
© SS with respect to thot RS is achieved, possibly involving wires running all over the brain.
Here we are using SS to refer to this more global relationship involving loop Ay its SE,
wiring from A's SE to the hypothelamus, and wiring from hypotholomus to the randomly
seerched over area containing loop A.

It Is this internal steady state which is the basic shaper of conditions of reinforcement.
When A's SE permits or leads to an internal repetition or ringing of A, A receives thousonds
of repetitions all in a short space of time. Repetition is the basis of conditioning (the
RP), s0 internal processing soon plays the dominant role in determining behavior. A
ringing repetition within the brain is vastly more important to the emission of a behavior
than the specific interactions it experiences upon emission, or the external conditions of
reinforcements The cttempt to account for human (and even rat) behavior os o function
of the external conditions of reinforcement is therefore doomed. That the interaction of
internal CR's plays o vastly more importont role follows immediately from the CRP which
implies that it is the number of repetitions of a coincidence that counts. Clearly, ringing
loops will establish the dominant, controlting CR's. What leads to a SS receives far more
support thon eny external stopping of external RS could ever effect. This view is related
to the comments of Milner (1957, ps 250). He states that "The reinforcement controversy
thus reduces to the question of how much firing is going on in the cell assemblies con=
cerned, reinforcing ogents serving only to increase thot firing through their effects on the
24
normspecific projection system." According to this theory, therefore, the orousing system
rother thon the need=reducing properties of the reinforcement ore those important for
learning."

In infonts in their ective phase, when there Is little internel life (cortex is inoctive),
it may toke @ hundred enacted repetitons to establish the dominonce of a given behavior.
However, as the child matures (ond the cortex becomes active) the SS condition gradually
‘emerges as the most important shaper of CR's. Once RS's ore internalized, on RD, if
established once over an equivalence class, Is established o: @ repeated ringing loop
sequence, 50 that “ance” is really thousands of times ond is enough to toke hold permarently. In addition, RD's can have their consequences elaborated to other situations by
internal SE much more ropidly than if this elaboration must await the actual occurrence
of these situations,

The internal RS process is embodied os an internal alternation among loop represen
tatives, and is induced by the SE of consequences. Any element in the SE (say loop Q),
that leads to a SS, though initially hit on only by chance, is repeoted internally and
thereby strongly reinforced for future occosion, The SS condition thus vestly extends
the range and sensitivity of the push of only faint, but potentially stoble, RD to extremes,

It is the extent to which, and the place where, © CR enters into « repeating loop
(ises its relation to @ SS) which determines its role in behavior. It is known that one has
no memory of events that occur in the 10 minutes immediately preceding shock or con-
cussion. This demonstrates the dependence of permanent connections on prolonged,
repeated ringing or the formation of SS's.

It is not pains or pleasures os such thot determine the emission or non-emission of
behaviors. Pains and pleasures ore subordinate to the $S.as the master reinforcer. What
5
contributes to the SS is reinforced. If one gets too comfortable while werking « problem
the tendency is to increase the "pain" level by opening a window. This does not increase
pleasure in the animal sense but doos contribute to the over-all SS by regenerating the
type of RS that past experience shows is useful in solving problems, Similarly Pavlov
has shown that the time needed to establish « CR is reduced by making the correlation
less thon 100%. This introduces a useful element of RS Into the learning process, keeping
the animal “on his toes" so to speck. Also, in this connection, Pavlov has shown thot
pains can be converted into pleasures and vice versa by conditioning. When “pain”
contributes to the SS it is preferentially selected, and when “pleasurc" threatens the SS
it is rejected.

These ideas can be rephrased in variational languoge, familiar to the physicist.
Any factor which contributes fo the over-all SS, or norrowing of random searches is
repeated and becomes reinforced. In fact, the reinforcement of a behavior via the SS
is a measure of the behovior's contribution to the narrowing of the RS. Thus odjustments
may be viewed os locked in by the variations from those adjustments, which variations
‘augment RS and so ore not reinforced and therefore rejected. This isa useful way to
view the encoding of the posture reflexes. Variations from good posture that ore sufficient
to excite @ RS ore not reinforced because they do not lead to repetition. Possible bad
postures (those exciting RS) are all used to condition the dominant (i.e. good) posture.

‘The nervous system differs from the usual servo-loop system in that o lerge number
of digital yes-no feedbacks replace the analog tailoring of one or two continuous feedbacks
to lock in given pattern. We have just mentioned how the stabilization of a given
behavior con be usefully anclyzed in terms of the RD's that specifically reject small
%
variations from stability. The rejected potters provide the feedback, when evoked
internally, which stobilizes the dominant.

This steady stote condition is thus, what ultimately shapes up the patterns of relative
dominance. The passions, or emotional drives, act by exciting o random search, At first
the child knows no more "why" it is searching than a tree "why" it is swaying in the wind,
By interacting with its environment the child hits on ways of stopping this random search,
cond these ways are usvally reinforced, because a reduction in random search usually contri=
butes to the steady state,

The concepts of RD and SS provide an abstract functionel framework within which to
discuss the character of given behavioral or thought sequences. We now tur to the problem
of using this functional model es o guide to the structure of classes of underlying wiring
diagrams copable of inducing a given behavior or thought sequence,

11, Translating to Wiring Diegrams

A schematic diagram of the over-all wiring is shown in Fig. 1, At the bottom are the
monosynoptic loops to the muscles. Sensory inputs from a given muscle excite directly
the horn output cells thot tighten that muscle forming a loop with only one synapse, The
ssoin of this loop may be regarded os of the order of unity, that is the sersory inputs are
{ust chout enough to maintain the hom coll outputs thot tighten the muscle. The upper
parts of the brain have their influence on behavior by raising or lowering the gain of the
lower loops. When the gain is raised above one, the muscles tighten. When it is lowered
below one, thoy relax.

The lowest loop is made up of large, fast alpha wires, while the regulating signals
from above are carried by the smaller, slower gamma wires. It is a bosic principle of
7
servo-loop design thet the regulating loop time constants must be longer than those of the
loops they regulate, The slower gamma activity precedes actual contradiction, by raising
the gain fn the monosyneptic elpha loops. Thon the facilitation from above collapses
previous to the alpha collapse, controlling it at every stoge. (Potton, 1969, pps 186-194.)

‘The sensory inputs from a given muscle rise to make direct and indirect contact with
cells ot upper levels which in tura fire on up, oF back down to lower levels, where they
contact the motor outputs (20 Fig. 1). In the figure the sensory inputs from the muscles
may be regarded as a sort of river that spreads out ond then converges back Into motor
‘output channels ot three upper levels, which form o sort of ladder. These upper levels are
played upon by vorious sensory inputs which may be regarded os serving to moke the passage
of the sensory muscle stream eosier ot thot point.

Now ossociated with the tightening of a synergic muscle group, will be upper loops,
which orlso because of interconnections between the motor outputs ond the corresponding
sensory inputs ot higher levels in the ladder (Fig. 1) built up because of the CRP itself,
These loops in the upper rungs of the “lodder" ore such thot If sufficiently facilitoted
they fire off the lower rungs and the associated act.

The upper rungs of the ladder are in places common pathways to many act sequences.
‘As such the upper loops have a little the character of flywheel factors, with o consideroble
degree of transferability. Soporation in the statistical overlap of common pathways must
depend upon the redundency with which the nervous system operates. In wiring terms,
this meons thet excitotions must cumulate on one loop sequence,but tend to be self=
cancelling on others.

The underlying muscle factors are organized in patterns of reciprocal enervation,
That is to say the facilitation of one act or act sequence inhibits others. From a wiring
2
diagram point of view, for exomple, the some wires that help tighten extensors may inhibit
flexors, This will induce a corresponding reciprocal enervation among the loops in the
‘upper rungs of the ladder. Thus the upper loops serve as o sort of internal symbolic
representative of the externol mutually exclusive motor acts or act sequences by which
they were first induced and which they facilitate. If act A inhibits act 8 "below", or in
the spinal reflexes, the loop representative of A will be negatively correlated with thot
cof B in the higher rungs of the ladder, s0 thot the same pattorn will repect itself above.

The concept of reciprocal enervation os thus generalized is a basic principle in
organizing not merely the spinal reflexes, but the whole brain. It is manifest, for exomple,
in Pavlov's negative induction offect in which the strong stimulotion of any point on the
cortex, tends to inhibit responses from other areas, Thus there is built into the brain an
Internal loop reprosentation of the emitted behaviors. These (gammo) loops are such that

4 when sufficiently activated they facilitate the lower (alpha) loops in such o way as to
leod to the emission of the astocioted behavior ond to exclude or suppress other competitive
cones. Elementary conditioned reflexes may thus be regarded as interacting vio their higher
loop represontatives, without being actually emitted. It is the discussion of the properties,
of such @ body of interacting conditoned reflexes, and more especially of the conditions
for the emergence of steady or self-facilitoting cyclic patterns, which forms the heart of
the present opproachs

The reciprocal enervation in conjunction with drive factors which preferentially
excite distinct centers, define o voriety of classes of random search, Tho motor sequences
which occur in these closses is in port 0 matter of chance ond in port a reflection of the
correlated structure of the environment (a released ball elways falls, an open hand con
only be closed, etc). These motor sequences may be regarded os linked together in the
F)
Upper rungs of the ladder. A motor sequence Is here represented os a set of loops each of
which excites @ successor which in turn quenches its predecessor. The upper loops find
subordination and regulation via their relation to the underlying motor acts they represent.
If they rise beyond @ certain point they engage these acts. It is only via this constantly
changing pattern of mutual quenching action thot the upper loops maintain a quasi-
independent activity and do not necessorily couse the emission of the acts which they
represent.

The breakup of the life chain into porallel factors may be regorded as embodied in
© :imiler breckup of motor loops into parallel groupings in the upper rungs of the ledder.
The establishment of an RD as among them, means that the recessive loops have collaterals
that facilitate the dominent loops, and the dominant ones have collaterals that go back
and inhibit the recessive ones.

12, A Principle of Construction of the Model

At this point it may be clarifying to make explicit one of the principles guiding the
construction of this model of the nervous system. It is assumed that any principle or
structural choracteristic found onywhere in the peripheral nervous system will oppeor
throughout the whole nervous system (i.e. the brain). The relevant parameters may differ
but the functional roles will be the some. We hove already used this principle several
times. For example, the concept of RE Is generalized os a basic principle in the organi
zation of the whole brain, not merely the spinal reflexes. Also, the gamma enervation
of the proprioceptors is generalized into the basic idea of loop reprosentatives whose
ringing determines the omission of the reprosented act.
0

In the some way the existence of internal sonsory devices in the muscles
(proprioceptors) suggest the assumption of internal sensory devices in the brain. The
eye also contains the so-called on-off cells which respond fo changes in the sensory
input rather than the input itself, This principle of operation of the external sensory
devices is carried over to the Internal sensory cells which detect the changes in activity
of the various parts of the brain, but not, for example, the continued ringing of @ memory
loop.

The idea is that the peripheral nervous systom is just "the brain come out" - out
to the surface where its function can be studied. Then the function, as discovered in the
Peripheral nervous system, is used 0 « guide to the function of the brain.

13, Contradiction and Differentiation

The lack of regulation to the CR (section 2) leads to « pattern of differentiation whose
steps might be described os ones of successive contradiction. The method of resolution of
fone random search excites others, whose resolution quolifies the firsts Indeed, there is no
differentiation or narrowing of the range of orders of emitted behaviors as apart from such
explicit contradiction, Thus, for examplo, a bell can be used to condition a salivary
response if followed by feeding. This response to the bell is initially generalized to
wide variety of sounds of varying pitch, and no amount of repetition with a bell of the
same pitch norrows the response. However, if bells of slightly higher end lower pitch ore
used, ond not followed by feeding, o differentiation in the response pattern quickly
emerges, It is deeply significant thot differentiation is for more effective thon specific
reinforcement in locking in responses. The differentiated response will lost longer ond
a
bbe harder to extinguish than the generalized response, though initially reinforced less
often and loss lavishly thon the undifferentiated response.

This is because the generalized CR is inconsistent with other CR = it is not
invariont - ond so it leads to contradictions and becomes inhibited sooner thon the
differentioted response which is for less apt to be inconsistent with other CR. This example
also shows the importance of differentiation os compared with reinforcement in learning.

It is only by differentiating our causal models of the world, not by skillfully arranging the
‘external conditions of reinforcement, that we can hope to build up a stable model of the
world.

Paths once differentiated out form more sensitive boses for catching new correlations,
Which the more general undifferentiated motor patterns wore unable to catch. Thus differentiation breeds or allows more differentiation.

Differentiation takes place in o step-by-step manner, using the underlying primitive
UCR 0s starting points, and constant sources of regulation, or subordination. The original
simple loop bundles associated with the unconditioned reflexes are by this process gradually
broken up into mutually excluding pieces. This breakup is accompanied by the cumulation
effect, in which the rejected possibilities form port of the essential stimulation defining the
dominant. Step-by-step, new,more invariant RD break up and reform the old patterns of
search, while preserving the RE. Rejection, os it becomes more precise, can become nore
widespread yet still leave some behavior in on emittable status.

Notice that this model contains no provisions for “cancellation” of @ connection once
made. A connection con only be displaced by overriding it with counterfactors. Thus
Internal alternation leads to « buildup of both faciliotory and inhibitory factors. Alter
ration is not mete repetition, First, it intensifies involvement at the branches of the
2
alternation, spreading its series elaborations over the cortex and so increasing the chance
of catching adequate invoriant corrolates to span this alternation, or establish stable
internal RD's, if they are potentially present in some already internalized experience,

IF this spanning does not occur, continued alternation leads to a stoge where a branch of
tho alternation is sufficiently excited so os to be able to lead to emission of the associated
act without benefit of convergence. The level of excitation rises and a de-differentiation
‘occurs: one of the branches of the elternation reaches o level of excitation high enough
to cause emission of the essociated act - one falls back on earlier childhood patterns.

Thus the one-way choracter of the CRP (that it leads to the moking, not the brecking,
of connections) in conjunction with the over-all structure of the differentiation process,
lready ot this early stage predicts @ general characteristic of breakdown patterns,

14, SE and the Regulation of Drives

The relation of ability to predict cheod to the opening of internal RS end internal
regulation is very central. It is the SE itself which provides the bosie source of regulation
of drive factors. Because the SE, when enccted, has in the past stopped the search, its
internal representation has connections that do the same. SE reduces these drive levels,
by the inhibitive effect of succesior acts on predecestors to just that minimum needed to
still achieve “satisfaction. For example, the baby yells when hungry, and then is fed.
Next time the state of boing hungry excites yelling, which excites the sense of being fod,
which reduces the hunger drive so that the child yells less. The yelling is reduced in this,
woy to that minimum necessary to achieve feeding. The crucial point is that the predictive
series elaboration itself regulates the drives. An interesting consequence foilows from this,
Es)
‘model oven at this elementary stoge. Since the drive is regulated by the elaboration,
the first effect of inhibition is to break down the elaboration and hence intensify the
drive, rather than reduce it. This seemingly poradoxical effect is well confirmed
experimentally.

‘The set of acts (or rather their loop ropresentotives) that follow a given act all
function to inhibit the given act via reciprocal enervation as generalized in the model.
Reciprocal enervation is assumed to occur, not only in sets of acts in porallel, but also
‘among the acts that form a series in time. Thus in walking, putting the right foot forward
inhibits putting the left foot forword, etc. This inhibitory effect of successor acts on
predecessors is to be distinguished from the much stronger inhibitive effect of say, possibly,
the fifth act in the SE of act Aon act A - the complete undercutting of A, by on inhibitory
recurrent collateral, thot prevents the formation of a SS and extends the internal RS to
nother candidate, The Inhibitory effect of all successors on predecessors reduces drive
lovels, but becouse of the existence of cumulation effects emission is not therefore
necessarily stopped. Thus, SE leads to a reduction in drive levels, isolated loops cease
to be able to go off on their own, and cumulation becomes essential to emission. It is
then that the internal life, which can only open in the absence of external action, begins
to develops

Howover, if drive levels become too low to define or bring about needed omission, a
counter-compensation sets in, More specifically, if the expectation of satisfaction is
thwarted then the drive factor reactivates the RS which is then solved out again, firming
vp the relevant RD's so emission can occur. Thus the first effect of inhibition is to increase
the drive level becouse it is the SE thot regulates the drive via its inhibitory effects. When
the Inhibitory, regulating mechanism is itsolf inhibited the rosult is to intensify the drive
u
factor. Although this result moy seem obvious subjectively, It can seem rather paradoxical
when viewed in external stimulus-response terms, The "inhibitory" stimulus seoms to
‘octually intensify the response ot first. Tracing back the couse of this subjectively obvious
but externally paradoxical fact to detalls of the wiring, links the three worlds of subjectivity
of oxterncl-stimulus-response, ond of wiring diagrams,

15, General Considerations: Comparison of this Model with Hebb's

Given the CR principle, generalized to include intemal interaction, one hos « form
10 plostic that the problem is not so much to find odded possibilities, but rather to discover
what ospect of the vast range of possibilities already implicit in the opproach is the con=
trolling one.

Mathematical models were once thought inadequate to predict noture. But, in fact,
hiding within the class of arbitrary differential equations wos the “answer”. The CRP is
10 broad, and generates > vost a class of possible interactions, as to be almost comparable
to the class of all differential equation. The problem is to find out "which" in this brood
class, not to look outside It, as one once looked outside mathematics. The finding of
“which” Is problem enough, and the formulation of the Issue in CR terms is no more an
"answer" than the confining of our concern to mathematical possibilities gives us Newton's
laws = though Bacon's focussing of thought in this direction wos very orienting.

In this connection it might be said that Pavlov, and later, Hebb (1949, 1958) assume
for psychology the role that Bacon occupies for physics, Pavlov focussed attention on the
‘CR concept and Hebb went @ long way toward showing the adequacy of the CRP as a basle
building block for nervous system models. His approach meets philosophical criticisms os
35
to the bare existence of an explanation in CR terms. If his model seems over-general
compared to those of others it is because he was wise enough to recognize the symbolic
‘adequacy of the CRP and so did not assume a lot of special machinery. His general model
cllows room for « more concrete and complete model without charging any of his basic
ideas, It is a great pionoer effort, not only demonstrating the possibility of building a
model of the nervous systeny but identifying many of the basic functional concepts useful
in doing s0.

Given the CR orientation, the general framework of the present model is forced on
fone quite rapidly by the facts. On the one hand, there is the vest body of evidence
pointing to the uniform functional character of all areas of the brain, Areas differ only
in the parameters of this common function, os for example in time constants, and ratio of
cells of different "type", and in the areas linked by the wires that come and go, ete. The
uniform functional character of all areas, forces us to look to the structure of the environ
ment, or of the inputs themselves, as the source stabilizing internal structure.

Spoctel brain conters do not represent a violation of this simple functional picture,
Rother they reflect the correlated nature of the environmental inputs, and their breakup
Into such classes for special processing. Certain centers are concerned with turning, rising,
etcs Certain areas are concerned with spreading the final output rhythms to catch special
coordinational regulation once the act is "decided" on (the cerebellum).

The reticular formation, in which the lower centers are all imbedded, is concerned
with the common functions not associated with specific centers, such os reciprocal enervation
‘and timing. The emergence of the special timing function is to be regarded as an indirect
cffect of the contribution to the steady state which such timing brings about. Unless nerve
%
firings ore properly timed s0 as to cumulate, they wash each other out. This "proper timing"
and “cumulation” may apply to only ono act or act sequence while hardly fitting ol! the
‘ethers. The great redundency of the information on which the brain operates, combined
with a few considerations from statistics, shows how easily such "statistical separation"
in the overlap can be effected despite widespread intorferences

‘The interrelation of the centers, and the unconditioned reflexes, represent merely o
genetic pre-oncoding of the emergence of dominant correlations, which pre-encoding
helps accelerate the emergence. Were this genetic encoding not merely a pre-acceptance
of the implications of the laws of operation of the nervous system these laws would rapidly
override the pre-encoded correlations.

‘The pattern of conters and their Interlinkage indirectly reflects and confirms these
ava of operation of the nervous system, as opted to the special class of correlations
which our present environment represents, just as the orbits of the planets indirectly
rofloct Newton's laws os applied to certain initial conditions.

‘There is also the evidence that, except in very spacial cases, no single nerve can
fire another nerve. On the cortex hundrods of nerves must be fired at once to set up any
secondary firing ot all, This forces thinking in terms of "bundles" of nerve fibers through
which the total nervous stimulation may increase and decrease. Thinking in terms of
"enlarging" and “contacting” bundles is @ great source of simplification in explaining
the differentiation process.

Finally, there is the rough statistical character of the brain's operation. Mest rofined
effects would be unstable, and lost in the statistical mess when linked to others, unless they
had the simple invariant choracter implied in the present model. Thus, the random
complexity - which looks so forbidding at first - 1s in fact a source of limitation on
7
the logical possibilities when approached from a statistical point of view with the realization
cof how fast weakly correlated links are self-cancelling os they compound. The rapid self=
cancellation of non-invariant or wock correlations os they compound, forces thinking in
terms of simple repeating coincidence effects between ringing loops.

The above three general considerations are very vieful guides in reconciling the known
facts or principles in a self-emergent causal framework. They help us particularize Hebb's
‘model. We take over his notion of "mediating processes" tn the form of "ringing neural
loops" but specifically view the loops as reprosentatives of motor behaviors, which motor
behaviors they serve to help engage when sufficiently activated, This contributes to on
understanding of how the loops are set up originclly, and combined with the generalized
principle of reciprocal enervation helps explain why they do not intorfore. There is also
the recognition in the present model thot this cyclic condition is not merely o character

‘ Istle of neural activity but also powerfully shopes it.

Storting with von Neumann's concept of o parallel colculator this model further
specifies the basic operation of the brain os that of e:tabliching relative dominances among
competitive classes of motor defined acts. Individual loops come into existence by separ
ration from big bundles of already existing loops. This provides o bosis for an explanation,
of their regulation ond stobility and the differentiation process. There are no sensory loops
in the present model; rother the sensory factors enter in by correlating or interlinking motor
loops. Such correlation con often oppor as “inducing” one response from another. Drum
beats holp force present states or loops on to extremes and excite successor states or loops
t their associated rotes, etc. They consequenctly facilitate motor sequences having or
Using these characteristics or correlations.
8

In short, this model spells out Hobb's mediating process concepts, carrying them one
step further towards a determination and explanation of the pattern of the outputs of the
nervous tystem. The indeterminism that remains can be related to specific analog
‘effects, Such analog effects, though they may not be predicted by the general theory,
con be ecsily determined experimentally and in conjunction with the general theory, may
lead to many significant predictions. Thus these experimental results con be combined
with the main body of the theory, as experimental facts of chemistry are combined with
the principles of chemistry ond physics, to lead to other new results.

Thore runs through human behavior a certain simple functional core which defines
« side of the pattern structure closely related to "meaning", and shows how the emergence
of such « type of pattern can be explained causally. This model concerns itself solely with
this patter side of human behavior.

16, Review ond Summary: Logical Flow Diagram of
the Processing of Correlations

In Fig. 2 (which will be discussed shortly) wo have on outline of the eorlier discussion
in the form of « logical flow diagram of the processing of correlations which, os 6 parallel
calculator, the brain picks up. The diagram is not @ model, ony more than physics is a
model of the world. The factors thot enter into the conditions of stability of a given be-
havior, like the factors thet enter Into the shaping of a bridge, are highly varied. The
narrowing in the river, the local town being where it is, the bribe to the city council, etes,
all enter in os essential factors shaping the bridge where and as it iss To try to combine
all these factors in one model would be more confusing then helpful, and olso, entirely
impractical.

The nervous system has the symbolic structure of a foreshortened model of the world,
‘As physics, in explaining the world, only provides a systematization for the compounding
of specific correlations out of the basic assumptions, 20 too the best one can do by way of
explaining the nervous system is to develop a systematic procedure for analyzing the
changet, or specific narrowings, in the order of emitted behaviors, and translating this
analysis into underlying wiring diograms adequate to explain this specific narrowing
causally. In this process behavior is onalyzed into its smallest motor details, just aso
‘golf pro or piano teacher must.

If we look at the over-all pattern of the theory, we see that it is a theory of learning.
But learning is not @ port of life, but the whole of life. Vihat is not learning, is nevertheless encoded as a foreshortened recapitulation of eorlier leornings Any emitted behavior
of consequence implies an eorlier learning process which shoped it up. The control
variables lie in this educational phase, All the rest of life may be viowed os either the
blind mechanical consoquence of adjustments established in these educational phates, or
new grist that feeds back in and reshapes tho results of these educational phases

The control variables lie in education, in our intellectual convictions and verbal
models. Thus what might ot First soem limited point of view, directed towords only
fone aspect of human behavior, learning, comes on closer examination to include essentially
all significant aspects.

In the model wires are positioned relative to the pattern structure of the differentiation
process, It is en indirect form of functional positioning, in a model only potentially
‘evailoble or implied, like the model of the world as indirecily implied by physics.

Now the pattern structure has, of course, analog aspects, But the mixing of analog
cand pattern effects loads in many cases to an obscuring of the basic simplicity of the
40
over-all operation, The analog aspects of the CR interactions are offen self-cancelling,
«5 the shape of the sand grains in the sond castle, or the moss of the individual atoms in
certain calculations of gas pressure (which depends only on the number of atoméa), s0 that
«a large number of central effects can be predicted on the basis of a rough abstract model,
without considering any of the underlying details, or analog effects.

‘Another way to view the structure of this method of analysis is against the backdrop
of old philosophical arguments which claimed such analysis was impossible, Thought, it
‘was roughly and variously said, could not be made objective, because of the inherent
subjectivity of our observation of it. Such o situation with cyclic interdependence exists
also in the cose of gravitating mosses in planetary orbits but does not prevent their
solution, Becouse one thinks about one's thinking proce:s does not mean one cannot
‘also build @ model of so doing, The paradox is resolved by presenting a model of the
cyclic interdependence itself, ond then proceeding in stages to get the needed answers.
‘One must not expect too direct, too automatic answers. Such expectations prevent us
from realizing how indirect or merely implied construction Is often quite adequate, or
can be mado s0 by @ variety of special devices tailored to the given issue in hond.

We may now review the earlier results, following through the logical flow diogram
(Fig. 2) in detail, We start with some set of random search (RS factors. These sets ore
highly individvel, being set by drive factors, as from the hypothalomus, os well as shaped
by the sensory inputs, pains, past history, etce, as is implicit in the logical feedbacks
from other parts of the diagram. Indoed the analysis into RS's is @ highly flexible one,
the choice being adopted to the specific narrowing or ordering of behaviors to be explained. The RS's overlap in many ways, and the division into RS's could be mode in many
ways. This ambiguity, in so far as substantive, reflects o real ambiguity in pessible methods
4
of conditioning. Mony wiring diograms, or methods of learning, lead to the same final
spocific behavior.

Now the behavioral elements in the randomly searched over class, the RS factors,
ore interlinked by the CRP on the besis of ono’s past history, and these interlinkings
become themselvessonsory dependent, in so far as they ore correlated to sensory factors,
€5 Is shown schematically in the next box.

These random search factors, os thus correlated by interaction with the environment,
‘are broken up and brought into perellel via the establishment of RD's. In 6 sense we bring
the branches into parollel fo find the RD. But neorly the reverse is also true - since
finding the RO lots us, in a sense, keep the branches in porallel. If no RD is found os
‘omong a set of competitive possibilities, then they connot long be considered together
ct once - each must on Its own find convergence or facilitation enough to engage its
essociated act and exclude others, The emergence of an RD is thus essential to "keeping
in parallel", in the sense of eliminating the competitive aspect among these mutually exclusive factors, so that they may be permanently excited together in any combination, yet
funnel into a common emitted acts

The search for an RD may be compared with the search for a Prime Minister (PM).
In the political aree, too, we have a set of mutually exclusive competitive possibilities.
They are brought into parallel in order to choose a PM. The PM maintains his dominant
position by his relationship to all those he dominates, Thus the thought of X as PM,
instead of Y immediately brings to mind X'sposition on a certain issue which functions
to stobilizo the choice of Y. In addition the choice of a PM and the formation of a
‘sovernmont provides the other “also-rans” with roles, The existence of a PM is what
cllows the simultaneous consideration of the positions (the functional interrelation) of
a
all the candidates in place of o succession of mutually-exclusive individual positions,
It is not on accident that there exists an analogy as perfect as this - it points to the
fact that the same typos of symbolic structures organize groups as organize the interior
of individuals,

This operation of establishing an RO we may regerd as the basic operation of the
brain os @ parallel calculator. The dominent path is defined es that which stops the
random search, oF narrows ite

Now the result of establishing a specific RD is @ logical feedback, reshaping the
initial random sworches. Indeed by splitting them up, it creates new, more sensitive bases
from within which to cotch the correlating effects of sensory inputs. This cyclic refinement,
pushing towards ever more invariant correlates, constitutes the differentiation process.

Patterns are locked in via the systematic rejection of competitive alternatives. This

‘ indirect form of conditioning already greatly simplifies the problem of finding adequate
R's out of which to compound observed behoviorss

‘The reconciliation of RD's emerging from different random searches, pushes us towards
ever more invariant correlates, until one is rejecting a lorge class of paths without self
paralysis and series elaborating, or "predicting, several stages ahead. It is then that one
begins to internalize the random search process itse!f. intemal processing occurs until the
series elaboration, the successors of a given "next" act, ceases to unstobilize that act,
and an internal repetition, o steady state, becomes possible. At this stage emission occurs
cr is set and interior attention shifts to some other random search which the involvement
in the previous RS hod inhibited out, via effects of reciprocal enervation as generalized
In the model
a

Now this internal alteration can be broken up into random searches in complete
enalogy to the external searches, and the external logicol diagram repeated on an internal
level.

‘Thus the historical sequence of engagement of the internal loop representatives of
‘external acts tends to be linked together, just as the corresponding acts were when enacted,
‘Alto internal sensory factors toke these intemal loop sequences into higher transference,
ies, they help to interlink or correlate them. Finally internal RD are established, os
that which stops or narrows internal random search and contributes to the SS. These intemal
RD have then an internat logical feedback, reshaping internal random search.

This internal processing is roughly what is called thought. Its effect is to greotly
narrow th external part of the random search. Only such act sequences os con meet the
internal SS condition will be emitted.

‘ The sensitive SS shaping is the key to understanding how we can compound a wide
variety of omitted behaviors out of simple CR building blocks.

‘The stopping of the internal random search leads to the emission (or setting for later
‘emiscion) of a behovior from the internally searched-over class. The act is emitted, or set,
‘waiting only the special circumstances of emission, os soon a the series elaboration ceases
40 upset the symbolically "next" step in question, In contrast, the stopping of the external
random search ends emissions from the astocioted class of Lohaviors.

Internal processing enormously extends the intensity ond range of thrashing, searching
for ever more invariant correlations, or correlations that are more often reinforced, or more
‘often contribute to a narrowing of the search. Though most random searches have no
“future", that is they fail to catch stable invariants, some somewhere do. Those compound,
boing propagated by imitation, esting slowly into the unknown, like acid, at every small
44
crevasse in those random searches that open, ists, whose RO's ore stable (invariant) enough
to stand up under generalization and support further differentiation,

The gencralized principle of reciprocal enorvation and the CRP, os extended by the
SS concept, provide a besis for explaining the stoble solf-emergence and self-regulation
of complexipattems in correlated environments which constitutes learnings

re
Ul, SOME APPLICATIONS

We will now consider a variety of applications of the model. This survey is designed
to suggest some types of application to which the model con be put even in this simplified
form, without ony detailed discussion of brain centers, cell types, and other more detailed
analog effects.

We shall presont a number of effects os "predicted" by the modol. These effects
were, of course, known bofore the model, and were guiding factors in the determination
of its features. They are presented as predictions of the model to help emphasize certain
of the peculicr ways in which types of explanation afforded by the model restrict patterns.
A vorlety of predictions and experiments suggested by the model of an as yet untested
character are now being prepared for publication.

1, Brain Stimulations ond Excisions

What type of “effect” might one expect on stimulating the brain? The model implies
thot the elementary reflex components, associated with primitive responses of locomotion
‘ond grasp ore repeated in the higher loops, and serve as the storting points of further
differentiation,

‘Stimulation in thot it fires ll oF a lorge part of the cells in o given area indiscriminate
ly could only be expected to reveal the lowest order correlations of that area, Thus we
might oxpect to elicit fragments of coordinated motor responses, or synergic muscle groups,
‘Also, since the reciprocal enervation runs through the entire brain, strong enough stimulation
‘ot one point on the cortex, might be expected to inhibit the other orcas. Both these effects
ore observed.
%

The simplielty of the organization of the human calculator Is revealed in such
elementary experiments. Most complex calculators have successive stages isolated from
‘each other, and stimulating a few hundred wires ot once is not likely to hove coherent
effects, The pecullar nature of the class of effects observed represents therefore « con=
firmation of the proposed principles of operation, specifically, the centrality of the motor
patterns and reciprocal enervation in the organization of the calculator.

‘Whot type of effect might one expect to result from brain excisions? The model
bated on the assumption of a roughly uniform function te oll ports of the brain, a given
rea differing only In the parameters of that common function, and the specific other
creas to which it Is linked. Hence, unless Finel output creas were cut into, one might
expect very little fo result from the removel of small sections of the brain, and such Tittle
2 does result, to be easily compensated by @ takeover of the given function by other areas.
This is In sharp contrast with what would hoppen if a small section of a typical calculator
were removed.

If we consider the great redundency with which the braln opsrates, ond the in=
volvement of wide arecs af the brain in all responses, one might further predict that no
specific memory or 1Q lo would result from removing small brain sections s0 long as
certaln crucial areas (eug. the speach area) ware not cut Into. The copacity required
for establishing a given reflexpottem it far greater than thet needed to merely maintain
It, since once established, foreshortened mathods of conditioning quickly toke hold,
making use of the more complex Initial CR's to stobillze them, Hence, establithed and
simplified reflexes with thelr great redundency would seem unlikely to be affected by
specific excisions, This Is Indeed the case (Helstead (1947)), and affords « confirmation
of this simple over-all functional picture of the Internal processing of the CR's via the
47

5, with no special internal mechonisms. Though it is easy to suggest special internal
machinery that will solve any specific problem, it is very herd to find any which con
ct once have pieces removed anywhere without brecking down, and be, as a "machine",
self-emergent via @ learning process - for complex learning Is not genetically encoded.

How can the interior of the calculator be so plastic and still hold some guiding
structure or principle of order? The answer lies in the recognition thot the internal
structure or principle of order is derived from the environment itself. As shown in the
experiments of Bexton, Heron, and Scott (1954), the level of pxychological functioning
soon fatis when the nervous system is not fed properly structured inputs. The stobility of
the internal structure depends on thot of the external environment. Only thus could the

competi ble

‘rect internal plasticity bo with or lead to internal orderings This internal
order emerges os the internalization of on external order, implicit in the interaction
with the environment.

When this key to resolving plasticity ond order is combined with the earlier evidence
‘on the central organizing role of the elementary motor potters, and reciprocal enervation,
the model os here presented is very necrly forced on one.

2. Processing of New Correlates

The self-emergent choracter of the major portion of the internal structure is @
powerful source of guidance, @ test thet few models con meet. Certain detoils of the
pottern of this emergence, as implicit in the present model, con be tested in a variety
of ways.
ry

‘Any new intemal correlate is apt to upset the old RD patterns and so initiate a
rudimentary random search. The centers are no longer balanced out, with this new
factor presents

Now internal random search, as we have seen, augments involvement at these points
Until either the drive level is raised, or the alternation predicted out, via the isolation
of adequete spanning RD in some form, The altemation may gradually take over the
whole brain, pushing for adequate resolving RD, and involving more and more inter=
locking rendom searches in the process. This extended search of course greatly enhances
the chance of finding invariant RD. Once adequate RD are isolated, a re-condensation
occurs. The eleborate over-all RD are used to recondition the underlying foreshortened
RD associated with narrower ranges of freedoms

Thus af first in piano playing we hold our fingers in certain positions "self-consciously",
later this self-conscious holding conditions on "instinctive" holding which does the same
thing using for less of the brain's capacity. As in solving a puzzie, when we find one
thing that must hold regardless of other things, we can use this fact to simplify end help
solve the many sub-problems,

Now this sequence of expansion and contraction of the range of nervous activity.
ostoctated with @ given correlation in process of its integration should be a highly
characteristic one, immediately monifest in the patterns of electrical activity of the
brain. The theory identifies the basic activity with the motor streams and motor loops
themselves, so there is no place for a sub-structure or the complexities of yet more
primitive brain processes, to obscure such effects, By way of contrast, in television, the
information is encoded on a carrier wave, and the details of this wave end the encoding
9
process, override and obscure the details encoded. The electrical activity In a TV set
has no simple relation to the content encoded, os is the cose in the brain,

Thete expansion and contraction effects are observed in a wide variety cf forms, For
‘example, a repeating tone has its own characteristic repetition frequency, by which response
associated with the tone in different areas of the brain con be Identified. Thus the spread
cand amplitude of response to the tone con be measured as a function of time. There isa
very characteristic initial rise and spread, followed by collapse in this frequency component
of the electrical activity of the reticular formation (Brazier, 1960, px 150).

‘Another example of the seme type is the change in electrical activity of the brain os
@ manual response is learned. In early learning stages the whole brain is involved in the
electrical disturbence associated with the manual response. Later, only the hond area is
involved (soe Gclantosand Morgan, 1960), Such contraction mey be viewed as an example
of the progressive simplification of encoding of @ learned response, using the initial more
complex encoding to ccndition or set up the coincidences needed for the simpler encoding,
Such o contraction does nat imply any speciol transfer or simplification process not implicit
in the CRP itself. Once o behavior is set up in more elaborate indirect ways, many simplor
Internal conditioning effects emerge to foreshorten the internal random serch.

3, Threshold Effects

Unlike most machine models, the present theory implies that the whole broin is
involved In the most elementary response, since factors ore integrated, thot is, enter stably
into a determination of significant calculating machine activity, only in and os they effect
the order of emitted behaviors. This has 0 wide variety of potential implications.
50

This should mean, for example, that a sensory input which served to Interlink cortaln
classes of motor factors, would be the more easily responded to the less such response oF
the tentory Input induced disturbed underlying motor factors, or the more nearly it fitted
into them.

Now this fs @ rather strange characteristic for a typical machine, In which the senst=
tivity of detection stages usvally i - not a function of how big a change in the output
pattem such detection will imply.

However, the link of perception to response, and the involvement of the whele brain
in response implied by the model, makes such a strong link between threshold and mental
state clearly implicit.

‘A wide variety of experiments conflem this implication. For example, Postman, Bruner,
cand Walk (1951) have shown that lines ond other patterns (letters) thot “fit" have a lower
threshold for being observed than those that do not. Expectation of the class of patterns
to be observed alto lowers threshold, etc. These effects go a long way towards directly
‘exhibiting the simplicity and directness with which the underlying representative motor
cycles are excited or linked by the sensory inputs.

4 Caught in Stop

‘The success or workability of this modal is closely linked fo the character of the random
searches excited. They must be "solvable" by a series of progressively better approximations
In such @ way as to open out into the main life problems. Most random searches have no
such future, Indeed most searches lead only to madness, The random searches for food
Provide a base structure which the sexual involvement con then open further. Sexvality
51
provides a reinforcement which forces us to internalize the chythms and attitudes of others
«5 IF our own, s0 that the emitted act must satisfy both people, Random seorch opened by
this method is of type most opt to catch significant invariant correlates. The search is
narrow, limited to an alternation as between the viable attitudes of two peoples Since
both bronches are viable in some context, the focus is apt to be an expecially productive
‘one in catching invariant correlates. Other closses of motivation, such as pain, excite
random searches s0 goneral os to lead to RO with little future, thot is RD that cannot be
further differentiated, The horm caused by excessive use of such motivation has been
brought out by Frster ord Skinaor (1957) os in their emphasis on the use of positive instead
of negative reinforcement.

What should heppon if internal wiring is radically reorganized about some random
search, such os pain, with no future? The implication of the model is clearly thot deoth
should rosult. The whole internal witing is subordinated to the principle of reinforcing
‘what stops random scorch, If the random search ostociated with pain were not clearly sub-
‘ordinated to that due to hunger, etcsy the basic rewiring it would effect could be nothing
short of lethal, when we consider how intimately the vegetative and motor sides are linked,

This is dramatically confirmed by catching animals in whet is called "stop". An
electrode is emplanted in areas whose stimulation is poinful, and the animal trained to
push @ button to avoid being shocked, perhops several times o minutes After @ few hours
of this the onimal dies,

Pain represents a type of induced internal random search, ond consequently leads to
fn internal rewiring. Pleasure, however, represents a stopping-ofthe random search, ond
hence stops even the spontaneous normal rewirings of curiosity. Olds end Milner (1954)
have shown thet if rat had an electrode Implanted In his brain in "pleasure" oreas that
52
stopped random search, and was trained to push a bution to "stortTM stimulation, and 0
stop or reduce the RS to an extreme minimum, no such negative effects os are associoted
With the earlier caught in "stop" would be expected, This implication of the model is
indeed confirmed. Animals caught in "start", pushing the button to obtain (not avoid)
stimulation, con continue for days (if fed) with no adverse effects.

‘These simplo experiments (soe also Hess (1954) and Delgado, Roberts, and Miller (1954))
‘expose the centrality of the role of the 2S in determining internal wiring. They confirm
ina direct way how closely the internal wiring is linked to the class of random searches
beeing stopped, ond so directly exhibit the central organizirg position of the random search.

5, Vision
‘0, Sensory Tokeover of Motor Patterns

This model predicts that the visual Gestalt, or visual oworeness, is only built up os
the gradual tokeover into higher control of already esteblithed underlying motor patterns.

In terms of wiring diagram this transfer of control to visuel sensory inputs corresponds to &
differentiation of loop bundles that go through the visual secondary projection areas This
rotor origin of what, at first, seems unrelated to motor factors, serves as a test of the present
model.

This process of gradval motor takeover by the visval field is confirmed in o.wide werlety
‘of experiments. When children are first born the cortex is essentially out of operation. The
cortex functions Inhibitively relative to the lower centers, and ot this early stage the child
Is investigating its own body, ond each isolated motor loop needs to go off with @ minimum,
convergence. Thus the initfal coordination is built up in o semi-blind state.
53

‘The first takeovers by visual factors lead to responses almost Indistinguishable from
touch, 0 point made by Koffka (1925). The child reacts te the sight of the object os to
its textures In order to recognize on object (6g. water, doll) at all the child has
to react as If it touched the object.

‘A few people have been blind at birth, and only galned thelr slght (exg. via removal
of cataracts) later after they could verbalize. (von Senden, 1932.) Watching the way
{in which these people learn to use the visual field confirms in many ways this general
picture of the visual function a one of takeover of underlying motor Factors.

Long before they are able to recognize objects in the visual fleld, they are ble to
tse bight spots or edges In It to selectively modify their behaviors, They can, for example,
bring the bright spot into the center of the visual field, They can also tell whether thelr
‘eyes are moving in the direction of a line or across It, Elementary motor responses are

iu thus controlled or correlated to visual factors, Later these motor links are used to recognize
shape.

Presented, for example, with a card having four spots and asked “how many?" these
people will not know, but they can use the spots to coordinate head movements and then
count the number of times they move their head, By this process they can distinguish the
umber of spots.

Similarly, at first they cannot distinguish a square from a circle, But if they move
their head along the line, they feel the bumps In the square that are not present in the
celrcle by the jerk in their movements, Later they can feel these bumps without actually
moving thelr head, ond might call the square "the bumpy one".

The ostoctated acts, head or eye movements, have been Internclized, and some unique
sensory combination has been found to take thelr associated loops into higher control on
54

transference. The "bumpyness" is then excited and felt without an associated emission,
‘When we consider the wide variety of sensory inputs created by the active probing implicit
in smal! eye movements, it is easy to construct or isolate sensory factors or combinations of
factors necessary to take the associated Internal motor loops into transference, Freinformatior
that helps limit and guides possible Induced motor organizations, further greatly simplifies
the needed encoding or needed distinctions

‘Many other experiments reflect this basic motor character of visual field organization,
To touch on "illusion" that was misintegrated, rapidly reorgantzes itso it is felt differently"
Wapner, Werner, and Chandler (1951) have demonstrated how tiring the muscles on one side
‘of the body shifts our sense of the vertical in @ field where there is no other source of
references

b. Organization into Wholes

Factors are integrated subjectively only in and as they narrow a RS and so effect the
order of emitted behaviors and form part of the parallel structure entering into the definition
‘of the present act. It is pattern clone thet counts. When we consider how ropidly @ geometri:
series expands (or contracts), this appoors as far less restricting @ limitation than it might
seem at first. A few stoges of such pattern elaboration can provide as accurate o discrémi-
ration as anyone could use. What is not locked in in this way os pattern, and is free to
float, subject to continuous variations thot are a function of the reinforcements, is something
subconscious and of no emotional significance to us, in the maine

Now the embryo of the visual Gestalt concept Iles in the set of parallel factors
"focussed" by RD into a single choice of acts We understand the room, via the wide field
55

of possibles it serves to reject, focussing us into one present act, The rot needs to run
‘round the room before it can eat quietly. Certein qualitative ospects of this parallel
structure, such as the disappearance and appearance in wholes, manifest themselves in
rather striking subjective phenomena, and help explain thems

Since one is dealing with an ordering rather than a continuous phenomena one would
expect pieces of visual Gestalts to appear and disappear as wholes. The complex structure
of these reflects sets of factors which combine together in the setting up of complox RD,

Such effects are observed. As illustrated in the phenomena of “Mach bands" (Dembery
1960, p. 202), even the subjective sense of o continuous color gradation is broken up into
distinct stops, or bonds, reflecting the principle that a sensory difference has no subjective
counterport till it leads to a distinct ordering. Differentiation occurs only vio contrediction
‘end associated distinet motor patterns or sequences rejected.

‘ In interpreting the subjective character of the visual experience in these terms it is
important to realize thot we see in any given instant for less than we reolize, that is, far
less than the grammar of our way of talking seems to imply. The complexity of perception
‘exists chiefly as an ossurance that ony one of «wide variety of complex details can be
(or have been) checked “at will". A knowledge of the laws of physics exists less os on
immediate awareness, thon os a confidence thot we con behave or respond in ways thet
solve problems if called on to do S06 In a somewhat different form this is also true of the
complexity of our visual awareness - though here problems are solved at such high speed
thet, untess wo observe ourselves very corefully, we will not realize how little we "seo"
tt any instant, The encoding in the brain parallels the logical depth rather than the multiplicity of the worlds A brick wall is encoded as its principle of repeated symmetry, in and
as it effects motor patterns, not as « photographic reproduction of tho wall. Preinformation

mokes the eye able to soe and the ear to hear far more than is there to see or heat, given
© few hints.

‘Though physics can never predict the waves of the sea, their gonoral pattern and
cchoracter can be predicted, and the specificity thot is loft is recognized as irrelevant,

This some is true of visual hellucinotion, The occurrence of visual hallucinations helps

confirm how completely subjective character depends on independently stable motor patterns

token over, and only In secondary ways upon the nature of the sensory inputs.
Subjective Status of Elementary Correlations

This simple model assumes that sensory inputs come to have definite motor tendencies
cond s0 a subjective character, only via their average function in correlating or inducing
‘one type of motor sequence more than another. The simplicity and immediate forcefulness
of this is illustrated in the subjective sense of greater nearness of lower objects, and brighter
objects, or the feeling of jutting out when there is a dark line ("shadow") below, etce

This type of observation helps confirm general implication of the model, to the effect
that these primitive motor tendencies are not due to special internal machinery, but are
merely an indirect effect of the CRP,

In these examples there is no need to postulate separate “detection” or "interpretation"
stages. No feeling of "deduction" is Involved in our interpretation of elementary corre-
lations. The identifications are immediate, subconscious, and necessary. Here again we
have an illustration of the great differences between parallel and series computorss

Low objects are in general nearer, as also are brighter objects. Things that stick out
cast shadows below holes, generally, have the shadow in the upper part, etc. Hence, low
objects tend to reinforce motor patterns associated with nearness, otce
7

Once sensory Inputs come to have motor aspects, they con be relied on for further
conditioning, but they are not, except porhops in a few very primitive respects, assoctated
with genetically defined factors. This is woll confirmed in the dramatic reorganization of
the visual responses that can be effected in a few weeks with special glosses, inverting
images, ete.

ds Contor Balance

Another closs of effects comes under the heading of center balance. The degree of
excitation or sensitivity of @ center Is according to this model regulated by what most
contributes to the steady state. There ore a wide variety of feedback mechanisms thot can
shift the level of all inputs at almost every stoge of thelr processieg. Smell variations in
these feedbacks, like external motor acts, get reinforced or not occording to the extent
thot they lead to 0 local ringing.

Now os the subjective effect only depends on the motor pottorns token over, not on
the inputs, shifts in center balance which regulate our sensitivity to sensory inputs should
produce subjective effects similar to actually widening the class of sonsory inputs. This is
dramatically confirmed ond illustrated in the Lond (1959) effect, where three shades of
neorly the same color give subjectively the offect of o full spectrum. It is also illustrated
in many other phenomeno, os where a sense af pitch or of roughness or straightness is
radically modified by immediately previous experience. Center balance is adjusted for
con optimum evoking of the full range of underlying motor Gestalts, and this may leod to
radically different subjective responses to the some input depending on the immediate past
history for which the $S adjustment to optimum center bolance was made. If very rough
objects have recently been felt, rough objects feel for smoother, for example,

6 Color

It is well known thet characteristic rhythms can produce the associated stcte of mind.
Hess (1954) hos shown that if the sleep rhythm is forced in the midline nucleus of the
thalamus, sleep is induced, though almost ony other rhythm there enhonces wakefulness.
This is on example of the depth to which the timing aspect of the CRP organizes the brain.

‘Any choracteristic rhythm may be expected to induce or support thet form of center
bolance, oF those attitudes, under which it would be spontaneously emitted. This is especial=
ly true when « factor is of the center of attention, for then its choracteristic rhythmic respons
Is amplified ond spread over the whole brain in process of acting out the random searches
it induces. In states of mind related to those induced by a given sensory input or rhythm,
its recognition is easier, or its threshold lowers This is just o restatement of the point mode
in Section 3, thot the sensitivity of detection is @ function of how big a change in output

‘ pattern such detection implies.

The prediction thet a rhythm may be expected fo induce or support or facilitate the
class of attitudes under which it would be spontaneously emitted is well illustrated in the
subjective character of colors.

Vision depends heavily on cells that fire when the light goes either on or off, sometimes
called on-off cells. As an edge posses over these on-off cells, they respond, hence edge
effects are especially important in organizing the visual field, Smal! vibrations, too small
10 notice, play an essential role in vision, os they move edges across several cells. Mechani-
cally holding the eye still for @ couple of seconds, s0 os to really stop these vibrations, cause:
images to disappear, os shown by Riggs, Ratliff, Cornsweet and Cornsweet (1959). Cohen
(1958) has demonstrated the disoppearance of color when the visual stimuli aro perfectly
9
homogeneous (A Ganzfeld), os when half « colored ping-pong ball is placed over one
eye. This Is further example of the centralityrof the role of on-off cells in vislon and
color perception.

Granit (1955, ps 288) has shown that one aspect at least of the color encoding lies in
the rapidity of rise of nervous activity of the off-response. The rise is rapid for red, and
several (obout 8) times slower for blue.

Now this model implies that sensory factors have a subjective character only in and
«0s they correlate or engoge underlying motor factors. The simplicity and directness of this
‘engagement leads one to expect that this more rapid rise of red should be accompanied by
© more rapid engagement of the associated class of motor factors It induced. This may be
taken os an explanation of the origin of the subjective character of reds The red excites
flywheel zepresentotives of c!csses of motor factors with a ropid manner of engagement
that gives them c distinctive subjective character, often termed "agressive" by artists. On
the other hand, the slow engagement of a motor factor gives more time for cumulation and
inhibition effects to take hold. This accounts for the more passive nature of blue.

Children, when very young, prefer rod, as it reinforces the class of motor pattorns then
most often emitted - those of relatively thoughtless investigation. Loter, as children neod
to integrate complex disciplines their proference shifts towards blue, as it reinforces the
slower type of motor engagement of disciplined response. Those represent examples of the
broader principle that environmental factors are so arranged as to reinforce the abstract
‘motor patterns most needed in present model-building. Such arrangements contribute to @
narrowing of random search.

Now Gestalis involving sudden rises ore ossociated with relative cortical inhibition,
cond lower center dominance, The Russians (London, 41954!) have found thet the threshold
60
for red is lowered by what relaxes and lowers cortical excitation (parasympathetic
stimulation), as harmonious tones, etc., and is raised by what excites the cortex (sympathetic
stimulation) os random noise, which latter serves to lower the blue threshold,

The argument would then go in this form. The cortex functions inhibitively with
respect to lower centers. When the cortex is less excited, lower centers are less inhibited,
‘and the patterns of motor activity will be more apt to be chavacterized by sudden rises and
rapid chonge. The little child hes a burst of activity just before sleop for this reason =
his cortex falls asleep first, releasing lower centers, Now red excites motor links which
have this characteristic factor rises Therefore, it should be easier fo respond to red in this
state of mind. When the cortex is more excited we have the same argument in reverse form
applied to blue. it is significant that red is preferred by childron in the early extraverted
phase when the cortex is less active, and blue becomes progressively more important to them

‘ 4s they internalize discipline and the cortex becomes effective enough to subordinate
thythms which have origin in lower centers (as the “vegetative” or parasympathetic ones),
@ subordination inanifest in the EEG, The EEG of children show moro pronounced low
frequency rhythms characteristic of vegetative areas. (See Walter, 1960, p. 296). These
low frequency rhythms which originate in the lower centers having to do with vegetative
functions are spread all over the cortex, Roughly speaking, a child is “all mouth".

This color dependent effect and o variety of other related ones can be Interpreted
under the general principle that the motor patterns more characteristic of a given state of
mind have lower thresholds when that state is present. The red Gestalt, as thus interpreted,
is the simpler Gestalt, not needing or involving time for secondary responding or converging
factors to distinguish it.

‘An aspect of this theory of color lends itself to a simple test. If a sense of red is
caused by a fost off, and blue by a slow off, one should be able to take white light and
make it oppear red or blue by turning it off foster or slower.

This prediction has been confirmed by Benham as discussed by Bidwell (1897) ond
Feynman (1963, ps 36-1). It is known as the Benham's top effect. A top with a split
black ond white field may be greyed in and then spun in such @ way that the white
switches off slowly by stages to black in the outer part, and turns directly to black in the
Inner part. In this case, when rotted at o speed where the duration of the off effects are
comparable to that measured directly by Gronit, the outer port of the top is tinted blue,
the Inner part red.

This explanation of the colors is @ point of deop philosophic significance. The sub=
jective character of the colors has long been used in mony philosophies as o classic example
of the supposed absurdity of attempting to "explain" the subjective, How "explain" color,
they say. This is @ concrete model with which to answer them.

People once thought It most absurd to build models of matter too, for much the some
reasons. A careful examination of the symbolic relation of this explanation to the subjective
sensation it represents contains morals of deepest philosophic significance,
